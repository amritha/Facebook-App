Facebook Homework for Codepath

Time Spent: ~10 hours (Really struggled with this one)

Completed Stories: 
* Required: Tapping on a photo in the news feed should expand the photo full screen.
* Required: Tapping the Done button should animate the photo back into its position in the news feed.
(Could not really get the animation part of this to work :( )
* Required: On scroll of the full screen photo, the background should start to become transparent, revealing the feed.
* Required: If the user scrolls a large amount and releases, the full screen photo should dismiss.
* Optional: The full screen photo should be zoomable.
